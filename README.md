# Red Tide PPC

**Community-driven red tide (PSP) advisory map and report tracker for the coastal waters of Puerto Princesa, Palawan.**

A public map of coastal zones colour-coded by advisory status, an anonymous way for anyone on the water to report what they are seeing, and a passcode-gated admin view that turns a credible report into a zone-wide advisory.


For the school presentation, see [Presentation review](docs/presentation-review.md).
The first-visit intro plays automatically and exits with one click; ↻ in the landing
header reopens it. The public map retains its original animated zone and advisory drawers.

## 1. The problem, in plain English

### What is a red tide?

"Red tide" — *pula ang dagat* in Filipino — is a **bloom of microscopic algae**. Under the right conditions (warm water, calm seas, nutrient runoff) certain single-celled organisms multiply explosively. In the Philippines the usual culprits are *Pyrodinium bahamense* and *Alexandrium* species.

The water can turn reddish-brown, but **not always**. A bloom can be dangerous while the sea still looks perfectly normal, which is exactly why a name based on colour is not enough on its own.

### Why it makes people sick

Some of those organisms produce **saxitoxin**, a nerve poison. Shellfish — *tahong* (mussels), *talaba* (oysters), *halaan* (clams), *tuway*, and *alamang* (small shrimp) — feed by filtering seawater, so the toxin concentrates inside their flesh.

Eating contaminated shellfish causes **Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP)**:

- Symptoms usually begin **30 minutes to 2 hours** after eating.
- It starts as tingling or numbness around the mouth, tongue and face, then spreads to the arms and legs.
- Severe cases progress to **respiratory paralysis** and can be fatal within 12 hours.
- **There is no antidote.** Treatment is supportive care — keeping the person breathing until the toxin wears off.

Three things people often get wrong, and this app repeats deliberately:

| Myth | Reality |
| --- | --- |
| "Cooking kills it." | **No.** Boiling, frying, grilling, vinegar and chili do **not** destroy saxitoxin. |
| "If it smells and tastes fine, it is safe." | **No.** Contaminated shellfish look, smell and taste normal. |
| "All seafood from that water is dangerous." | **No.** Fish, squid, shrimp and crab are generally safe if they are fresh, have their gills and intestines removed, and are washed under running water before cooking. The toxin sits in the organs, not the meat. |

### Who decides officially?

The **Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR)** tests shellfish and seawater and publishes shellfish bulletins and advisories. The Philippine regulatory limit is **60 µg of saxitoxin per 100 g of shellfish meat**; above that, gathering and selling shellfish from the area is banned.

### The gap this project targets

Official testing is authoritative but **slow to reach a specific cove**, and it cannot cover every shoreline every day. Meanwhile the people who notice first are the ones already on the water: fishers, *gleaners*, boat operators, resort staff, residents walking the shore at low tide.

Red Tide PPC gives those sightings somewhere to go, and gives a local reviewer a fast way to raise a visible warning for one specific zone — while being explicit that **it is not a substitute for a BFAR advisory**.

## 2. What the app does

**Routes**

- `/` — the landing page: what this is, the live zone readout and figures, and the way in.
- `/map` — the public map (lazy-loaded; the landing and admin never pay for Leaflet).
- `/admin` — the passcode-gated review queue.

**Core loop**

1. **Public map at `/map`** — a Leaflet map of the Puerto Princesa coastline. Each zone is a coloured nearshore band hugging the actual shoreline (see §10):
   - 🟢 **Safe** — no advisory recorded.
   - 🟡 **Unconfirmed** — flagged by an admin as needing a check; treat with caution.
   - 🔴 **Advisory** — confirmed; do not eat shellfish from this zone.
2. **Tap a zone** → a popup shows the name, current status, plain-language guidance, how many community reports are waiting for review, and when the status last changed — plus a **"Report something here"** button.
3. **Report form** — a description plus an optional photo. No account, no name, no login. The report is written to Firestore with status `pending`.
4. **Admin view at `/admin`** — behind a passcode. Pending reports are listed with zone, description, photo and timestamp.
   - **Approve** → the report becomes `confirmed` **and** its zone becomes `advisory` with `lastUpdated = now`.
   - **Reject** → the report becomes `rejected` and the zone is left exactly as it was.
5. **Manual control only** — zone status never changes by itself. When the water is cleared, an admin reverts the zone to `safe` from the admin view's **Zones** tab.
6. **Optional shipping-channel overlay** — a ship icon in the header toggles dashed blue PCG traffic-lane lines for the port approach (see §11), so someone drifting while gleaning can see where ship traffic is channelled. Off by default; a safety reference, not an advisory.

## 3. Quick start (no Firebase project required)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL Vite prints. **If no Firebase keys are present the app runs in demo mode**: the same UI, backed by an in-memory store that mirrors to `localStorage`. Nothing leaves the browser, and a banner says so. That is enough to click through the entire loop in a demo.

To use the admin view locally, create a `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

and set at least:

```
VITE_ADMIN_PASSCODE=whatever-you-like
```

Then open `/admin` and type that passcode.

> **Demo-mode tip:** demo data lives in `localStorage` under `red-tide-ppc:demo:v1`. Clear site data (or run `localStorage.clear()` in the console) to start over with all zones `safe`.

---

## 4. Connecting a real Firebase backend

The app uses **Firestore for data and Cloudinary for photo uploads — no Firebase Auth**.

### 4.1 Create the project

1. [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) → **Add project**.
2. **Build → Firestore Database → Create database** (start in production mode; the rules below replace the defaults).
3. **Project settings → General → Your apps → Web app (`</>`)** → register an app and copy the config object.

### 4.2 Fill in `.env`

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIza...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=000000000000
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:000000000000:web:0000000000000000
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your-unsigned-upload-preset
VITE_ADMIN_PASSCODE=change-me
```

`.env` is gitignored. Everything prefixed `VITE_` is compiled into the public JavaScript bundle — these are identifiers, **not secrets**. Access control belongs in the security rules.

Restart `npm run dev` after editing `.env`; Vite only reads env files at startup.

### 4.3 Configure Cloudinary photo uploads

1. Create a free account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free).
2. In the Cloudinary console, copy your **Cloud Name** from **Settings → API Keys** into `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`.
3. Go to **Settings → Upload → Upload presets**, create a preset with **Signing Mode: Unsigned**, and put its preset name in `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET`.

The upload preset name and cloud name are public browser configuration, not secrets. Restrict the unsigned preset in Cloudinary (for example, allowed formats and file size) before production use.

### 4.4 Deploy the Firestore security rules

The repository ships `firestore.rules` (wired up by `firebase.json`):

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase use --add          # pick your project
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

Or paste the contents into the Firebase console under **Firestore → Rules**.

> ### ⚠️ These rules are insecure by design
>
> There is no authentication in this MVP, so the rules cannot distinguish a fisherman from an attacker:
>
> - `reports` must be **world-writable**, or nobody can submit anonymously.
> - `zones` must be **world-updatable**, or the admin's Approve button cannot flip a zone to `advisory`.
>
> What they still enforce: fixed document shapes, **every new report must start as `pending`** (nobody can self-confirm), zone updates restricted to `status`/`lastUpdated`, and no deletes.
>
> Before any real deployment, add Firebase Auth with an admin custom claim and lock writes behind it. The rule files show the intended shape in a comment.

### 4.5 Seed the zones

Zones are **pre-seeded, never user-created**:

```bash
npm run seed:dry-run   # show what would be written, write nothing
npm run seed           # create any missing zones
npm run seed -- --force  # overwrite existing zones (resets status to "safe")
```

The seed script reads the same `.env` as the app and writes the seven zones defined in `src/data/zones.ts` into the `zones` collection with `lastUpdated = serverTimestamp()`.

Polygons are stored as arrays of `{lat, lng}` objects: Firestore rejects nested arrays, so the `[lat, lng]` tuples the app uses are converted on the way in (`toFirestorePolygon`) and back to tuples on the way out (`normalizePolygon`). `seed:dry-run` also validates every payload shape before touching the network.

### 4.6 Verify

Reload the app. The amber **demo mode** banner should be gone, and a report submitted in one browser should appear in the admin queue of another.

---

## 5. Admin review workflow

| Action | Report status | Zone status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Approve** | `pending` → `confirmed` | → `advisory`, `lastUpdated = now` |
| **Reject** | `pending` → `rejected` | **unchanged** |
| **Zones tab → Safe / Unconfirmed / Advisory** | unchanged | set directly, `lastUpdated = now` |

Submitting a report never changes a zone by itself — otherwise a rejected report would leave a zone stuck in a changed state. The number of pending reports per zone is shown on the map popup and in the zone list instead.

---

## 6. Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server (binds `0.0.0.0`, so phones on the same network can open it) |
| `npm run build` | Type-check (`tsc -b`) then production build into `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the production build locally |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type-check only |
| `npm test` | Run the Vitest suite once |
| `npm run test:watch` | Vitest in watch mode |
| `npm run seed` | Seed zones into Firestore |
| `npm run seed:dry-run` | Seed preview, no writes |
| `npx tsx scripts/generate-zones.ts` | Regenerate the zone polygons + coastline reference from `scripts/coastline-cache/` (verifies geometry, then writes `src/data/zones.ts` + `src/data/coastline.ts`) — `--check` verifies without writing (§10) |
| `node scripts/fetch-coastline.mjs` | Raw OSM coastline fetch (runs in CI — `.github/workflows/fetch-coastline.yml` commits the result to `scripts/coastline-cache/`) |
| `node scripts/fetch-seamarks.mjs` | Raw OSM seamark sweep for the shipping-overlay provenance (runs in CI — `.github/workflows/fetch-seamarks.yml`, §11) |
| `node scripts/map-motion-pass.mjs` | Real-browser verification of the map's zone / camera / drawer / pin / location / glide / orb animations (headless Chromium; it needs a manual NSS/chromium-libs bootstrap because this sandbox has no system NSS — `CHROMIUM_LIB_DIR`, with the full recipe in `scripts/route-transition-pass.mjs`'s header) |
| `node scripts/route-transition-pass.mjs` | Real-browser verification of the route dissolve (`/` <-> `/map`; `/admin` stays instant) |
| `node scripts/route-transition-filmstrip.mjs` | Before/after filmstrip capture for that route dissolve |

**Split suggestion:** one developer owns `Map.tsx` / `MapPage.tsx` / `StatusPanel.tsx`; the other owns `ReportForm.tsx` / `Admin.tsx` / `AdminGate.tsx` / `ReportCard.tsx`. `store.ts`, `types.ts` and `status.ts` are the shared contract — change them together.

## 8. Data model

**`zones/{zoneId}`** — pre-seeded, admin-editable

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | e.g. `honda-inner` |
| `name` | string | shown on the map |
| `description` | string | one-line plain-English description |
| `polygon` | array | array of `{lat, lng}` objects (the app converts to/from `[lat, lng]` tuples; Firestore forbids nested arrays) |
| `status` | string | `safe` \| `unconfirmed` \| `advisory` |
| `lastUpdated` | timestamp | set with `serverTimestamp()` |

**`reports/{reportId}`** — anonymous user submissions

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `zoneId` | string | which zone this is about |
| `description` | string | 10–2000 characters |
| `photoUrl` | string \| null | Cloudinary secure image URL |
| `submittedAt` | timestamp | `serverTimestamp()` |
| `status` | string | `pending` \| `confirmed` \| `rejected` |

---

## 9. Deploying

Any static host works — `npm run build` produces `dist/`.

**Vercel** — `vercel.json` already rewrites every path to `index.html` (needed so `/admin` survives a refresh). Set the `VITE_*` variables under *Project → Settings → Environment Variables*, and add them for **both** build and production.

**Netlify** — build command `npm run build`, publish directory `dist`. `public/_redirects` handles the SPA fallback. Set the same `VITE_*` variables under *Site configuration → Environment variables*.

Notes:

- Env vars are baked in **at build time**. Changing them requires a redeploy.
- Make sure the deployed Firestore rules are the ones in this repo, and restrict the unsigned Cloudinary preset for production.
- Map tiles come from OpenStreetMap and need the visitor to be online.
- If you pause/unpause auto-publishing to conserve build minutes or bandwidth on a free tier: a **paused site serves nothing to visitors**, and new commits won't auto-deploy until you resume it. Before pausing again after a redeploy, confirm the deploy log shows every stage (Initializing → Building → Deploying → Cleanup → Post-processing) as **Complete** — otherwise you can end up pausing mid-build on a stale or broken version without noticing.

## 10. Zone boundaries

The polygons in `src/data/zones.ts` are **machine-traced approximations generated from the real OSM coastline** — not survey boundaries and not official BFAR fisheries areas.

Each zone is a **single simple polygon of 63–270 vertices**: a nearshore band whose **landward edge is a dense run of real OpenStreetMap coastline nodes** (verified to stay within 20 m of the mapped coastline everywhere) and whose **seaward edge comes from a true geodesic line buffer of that run**. Both edges are Douglas–Peucker simplified (landward ε = 8 m, seaward ε = 15 m). Where an inlet is narrower than the opposing banks' buffers, those banks bound the water instead of forcing a full-width strip onto land. These are distance-to-shore approximations, not measured depth contours.

| id | What the band covers | Band | Vertices (landward / seaward) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pp-bay` | Bancao-Bancao → Pristine Beach → port basin → San Jose shore → northern apex → opposite bank south to `9.7712302, 118.7161899` | 400 m | 270 (202 / 68) |
| `sta-lourdes` | Peninsula east coast: Blue Palawan shore → Tagburos mangrove inlet → Sta. Lourdes wharf pier complex → harbour shore | 350 m | 124 (77 / 47) |
| `honda-inner` | Honda Bay west shore, from N of the wharf pier complex north to 9.894 | 350 m | 67 (45 / 22) |
| `honda-outer` | Mangrove shore and tidal channel north to just W of the creek mouth | 350 m | 63 (43 / 20) |
| `binuatan` | Northeast coast: Honda Bay mouth → off Marayugon → around the 9.9812 headland → toward Babuyan | 400 m | 95 (60 / 35) |
| `sabang` | St. Paul Bay: NW end of the shore → Sabang village and boat terminal → east along the bay | 350 m | 161 (117 / 44) |
| `irawan` | Iwahig approach → Irawan estuary → original east-wall cap at `9.7719706, 118.7124480` (unchanged) | 400 m | 65 (37 / 28) |

**How they are generated** (and re-generated — do not hand-edit the coordinates):

1. CI (`.github/workflows/fetch-coastline.yml`) runs `scripts/fetch-coastline.mjs`, which pulls every `natural=coastline` way in the seven zone bboxes from Overpass plus the documented ways from the OSM API, and commits the raw geometry to `scripts/coastline-cache/osm-coastline.json` (the dev sandbox has no egress to those APIs).
2. `npx tsx scripts/generate-zones.ts` walks the coastline graph (Dijkstra between per-zone anchors), bridges thin out-and-back spurs (piers, fish pens — only where the bridge chord stays within 15 m of the real coast), builds the buffer, verifies **landward deviation ≤ 15 m, ring simplicity, pairwise non-overlap and band width**, then writes `src/data/zones.ts` and `src/data/coastline.ts`.
3. `src/data/zones.test.ts` asserts the property that actually matters: **every point of the landward edge within 20 m of the real coastline**, plus simplicity and non-overlap — so the "jagged blade" or "floating offshore strip" regressions fail CI instead of waiting for a human to eyeball screenshots.

Where two strips face the same way they share one end-cap vertex exactly (`honda-inner`/`honda-outer` at `[9.893315, 118.748879]`). At the Sta. Lourdes wharf (E-facing meets N-facing), each zone retains its natural cap instead of forcing a shared one.

**Scoped pp-bay extension (2026-09-20):** pp-bay now rounds the apex on way `1529960721` and follows the opposite bank on `1529960722` only as far as node `368426821` (`9.7712302, 118.7161899`). This covers the previously omitted water at `9.7725, 118.7170`, approximately 88 m from the real shore. The banks' buffers meet inside the narrow inlet, so this is part of pp-bay, not an overlapping eighth zone. Irawan's polygon is unchanged; **the wider bay-mouth gap remains unfilled**. Regression tests check the entire added shoreline, water/land probes on both sides, non-overlap, and offshore exclusions.

Coastline sources: OSM API and Overpass (cache fetched 2026-09-20 by CI); the way ids behind each edge are listed in the header of `zones.ts`. Historical visual check renders live in `docs/coastline-shots/`.

Caveats worth knowing:

- Thin water-side structures (the Sta. Lourdes pier complex, fish-pen fringes off Bancao-Bancao and Sabang) are bridged at their foot: the landward edge stays within 20 m of the real coastline but does not thread around every piling. They mark an area, not a precise boundary line.
- Because the bands hug the shore, the Honda Bay islands — Cowrie, Cañon, Luli, Starfish and the rest — fall **outside** them, in open bay water. A report about an island trip belongs to the zone the boat left from.
- The mangrove creek complex at the head of Honda Bay (way `1530271757`) is deliberately **not** traced: it doubles back on itself through the mangroves, and following it is what produced the earlier jagged, self-intersecting polygons. The `honda-outer` band stops just short of its mouth.
- `binuatan` is a legacy id: there is no coastal place called Binuatan (the only Binuatan in the Philippines is a weaving centre in Barangay Santa Monica, inside the city). That polygon covers the real northeast-coast water off the Marayugon and Babuyan barangays.

> **Provenance note:** these polygons have been redrawn three times, and the first two revisions both over-corrected. An early revision placed them by offset from the coastline with the vertices deliberately kept clear of the mapped shore, which put the shapes out in open water. The fix for that pasted raw coastline traces straight into the polygons, leaving every zone jagged and self-intersecting. The third revision (2026-09-18) was accurate at six shore corners per zone but too sparse: the straight chords either cut across land in zigzags or floated in a gap offshore, depending on which side of the real coastline the sparse corners landed. The current bands (2026-09-19) are generated end-to-end by `scripts/generate-zones.ts` with the landward-edge tolerance asserted by test — do not hand-place vertices; run `npx tsx scripts/generate-zones.ts --check` and `npm test` before committing any geometry change.

Before this is used for real public-health decisions, replace them with the actual boundaries from BFAR or the Puerto Princesa City LGU.

**If you edit the polygons:** zones are seeded into Firestore, so an existing project keeps the old coordinates until you re-seed — `npm run seed -- --force`. In demo mode, clear `localStorage` (`red-tide-ppc:demo:v1`) to re-seed from the file.

## 11. Shipping channel overlay (PPTSS)

A toggleable **navigation-hazard layer** under the advisory zones: the boundary lines of the **Puerto Princesa Traffic Separation Scheme** — the official PCG shipping lanes for the port approach, which the pp-bay advisory waters sit right next to. Small craft (under 20 m), sailing vessels and fishing boats are directed by the circular's own rules to stay inshore of these lines and, if they must cross, to cross at right angles — exactly the audience drifting while gleaning.

**Sourcing (honest):** OpenStreetMap has **no** shipping-lane data for this area — a dedicated Overpass sweep (2026-09-19, `scripts/fetch-seamarks.mjs` + CI, raw result in `scripts/seamark-cache/osm-seamarks.json`) found only 5 seamark-tagged objects in the whole bay region (three lighthouses, a pier, a coast guard station) and nothing route-related anywhere near Palawan. So nothing here comes from OSM. Every coordinate in `src/data/shipping.ts` is transcribed verbatim from the Philippine Coast Guard's circular — *"Puerto Princesa Traffic Separation Scheme (PPTSS)"*, MC of 06 June 2017 (rescinds MC 02-15 of 2015), boundaries per NAMRIA Chart Nr. 4333 — retrieved via the Internet Archive after the live coastguard.gov.ph PDF proved unreachable. It is an **unofficial transcription of an official document**, not a chart digitisation: the in-app tooltip and `src/data/shipping.test.ts` both carry the source and that caveat (the test also asserts the circular's stated geometry — 60 m separation zone, 400 m lanes, 292°T in / 112°T out — so a transcription typo fails CI).

**Rendering:** dashed **blue** lines with a white casing (`src/components/ShippingLayer.tsx`) — deliberately unlike the green/yellow/red advisory palette; lines, never fills; hazards (submerged wreck, Gideon Shoal buoy, fairway buoy) as blue dots. Tap/hover says "Shipping channel — do not cross" plus a one-line note per feature and the transcription disclaimer. The layer is **off by default** (ship icon in the header toggles it — `useState` in `MapPage`, not the store) and draws *under* the zone polygons, so it never competes with advisory status. Because the toggle is icon-only, first-time visitors get a one-time auto-dismissing hint bubble under it (`red-tide-ppc:hint:shipping:v1` in localStorage — "Got it" button, 9 s timeout, dismissed for good once tapped; quiet if storage is unavailable). It is **not seeded into Firestore** — static reference data, nothing admins approve or reject. A static verification render (zones + coastline + overlay) lives at `docs/shipping-overlay-shots/pptss-overlay.png`.

**If the PCG/PPA publishes a revised scheme or a chart digitisation:** update the coordinates and `sourceDms` in `src/data/shipping.ts`; the tests verify the stated geometry. If this is ever used for anything beyond a visual aid, verify against NAMRIA Chart Nr. 4333 first.

## 12. Explicitly out of scope for this MVP

- **No user accounts** and no auth beyond the admin passcode gate.
- **No push notifications** and no SMS/route-based alerts.
- **No BFAR API integration or scraping** — status is entered by a human admin.
- **No automatic expiry or decay** of zone status; reverting to `safe` is a deliberate admin action.
- **No geolocation or per-report coordinates** — a report belongs to a zone, not to a point.
- **No moderation history or audit trail** beyond the report's final status.

---

## 13. What to fix before real use

1. **Replace the passcode with Firebase Auth** and an `admin` custom claim; lock `zones` and `reports` updates behind it. The current gate is a string compare against a value that is readable in the page source.
2. **Tighten `firestore.rules`** once zones are seeded (`allow create: if false` on `zones`).
3. **Add rate limiting / basic spam control** on report creation — right now anyone can flood the queue.
4. **Store the reviewer and timestamp** on approve/reject for accountability (`reviewedAt` is already written; `reviewedBy` needs auth).
5. **Replace the polygons** with real boundaries (see §10).
6. **Compress or resize photos client-side** before upload to keep bandwidth use and load times down.

---

## 14. Tests

```bash
npm test
```

A growing suite across the following areas (see `docs/` for the browser-verification write-ups behind recent UI passes — the side-drawer map layout, header fade timing, hero full-bleed, coastal polygon accuracy):

- **`src/App.test.tsx`** (jsdom) — the whole loop rendered for real: landing → map → tap a zone → report → `/admin` → wrong passcode rejected → correct passcode → Approve → zone turns advisory → public map shows the advisory. Plus the landing page's decrypted hero and live readout, a photo attachment run end to end, and a check that a too-short report submits nothing.
- **`src/pages/mapPass.test.tsx`** (jsdom) — the six-item visual pass, DOM side: peek row content + hidden body, anchor cycling, the `zone-path` fill ramp, attribution, zoom-control placement, and the full report → approve loop.
- **`src/components/Map.test.tsx`** (jsdom) — the production `zone-path` regression: the class lands on the path node in a single-pass render (no StrictMode double effect), `--selected` syncs from first mount onward, the fill ramp follows selection, and press feedback lights/releases the polygon.
- **`src/store.test.ts`** — the real store against the real (in-memory) backend: seeded zones load `safe`; `submitReport` writes a pending report; short descriptions are refused; `approveReport` confirms the report **and** flips the zone to `advisory`; `rejectReport` leaves the zone untouched; manual revert to `safe` works; pending counts are right; the passcode gate only unlocks on an exact match.
- **`src/lib/firestoreMapping.test.ts`** — the production-only mapping path: Timestamps, GeoPoints, unresolved `serverTimestamp()` values, malformed documents, and polygon values.
- **`src/motion/sidePanelAnchors.test.ts`** — the drawers' snap arithmetic: offsets, clamping, velocity projection, flick gating against a mirrored (left-edge) drawer, and the tap-after-drag guard. (The bottom sheet's equivalent suite retired with the sheet.)
- **`src/lib/firebase.test.ts`** — `readFirebaseConfig` returns a config only when all five keys are real, so a half-filled `.env` falls back to demo mode instead of half-initialising Firebase.
- **`src/motion/readouts.test.ts`** — the data-derived copy: peek summary, anchor readout, dominant status, advisory share.
- **`src/data/zones.test.ts`** — polygon sanity: 4–7 zones all starting `safe`; unique ids plus non-trivial names and descriptions; at least 3 plausible vertices each, all inside the Puerto Princesa box; raw `[lat, lng]` tuples still contain nested arrays (exactly why `scripts/seed.ts` must serialize them) and survive a Firestore round-trip intact; **no two zones overlap** — no interior edge crossings and no vertex of one strictly inside another, while shared boundary vertices and edges are allowed so neighbours can tile; every zone anchored within ~250 m of a real OpenStreetMap coastline node; **every zone a simple polygon (no self-intersections)**; **every point of the landward edge within 20 m of the zone's real OSM coastline run** (`src/data/coastline.ts` — the direct guard against both the "chords cutting across land" and "floating offshore gap" regressions); and `zonesBoundingBox` contains every vertex and `MAP_CENTER`.
- **`src/lib/backend.firebase.test.ts`** — Cloudinary uploads use the correct endpoint and form fields, return `secure_url`, and surface configuration/API errors.
- **`src/lib/firestoreSeedValidation.test.ts`** — seed payloads pass the shape Firestore actually rejects on.
- **`src/data/shipping.test.ts`** — the PPTSS transcription: every coordinate round-trips against its published DMS values, the circular's stated geometry holds (60 m separation-zone ends, lane boundaries 400 m ±30 m off the zone, inbound/outbound bearings match the published 292°T/112°T), every feature carries a plain-language note, and the source citation names the PCG circular (not OSM) with the unofficial-transcription disclaimer (§11).

The Firestore mapping tests matter because that code only runs against a real project — the demo backend never touches it.

### Browser pass (real Chromium)

The six-item visual checklist (peek row, drag/flick anchors, polygon fill ramp, attribution legibility, zoom-control clearance, report → approve E2E) no longer has a single script of record: `scripts/final-pass.mjs` was deleted with the bottom sheet. Five of the six items still run in a real browser:

- `scripts/map-drawers-pass.mjs` — items **2, 4 and 5**: structural clip tracking at every sampled drag position plus the fast flick for both drawers (with the tap-after-drag guard, ArrowLeft/Right and reduced motion), attribution present/visible/on top *through* the open drawer, and zoom-control clearance with its 44px hit areas and the pills × zoom × tabs × windows × attribution overlap matrix.
- `scripts/map-motion-pass.mjs` — item **3**: the `zone-path` fill ramp, computed mid-ramp and at rest, plus the selection stroke/thickening and dim steps.
- `scripts/live-data-map-pass.mjs` — item **6**: the report → approve E2E through a real popup, report form and admin approve, plus the live-region ARIA contract, at four widths × reduced motion on and off. Its bottom-sheet anchor walk was replaced by the drawer's grab tab and zone list on 2026-09-24.

Item **1** (peek row) has **no browser-side check**: it retired with the bottom sheet, and its successor, the drawer header strip, is covered in jsdom only. The same report → approve loop also runs in jsdom — `src/pages/mapPass.test.tsx`, with the whole loop in `src/App.test.tsx`. (Admin actions keep their own live pass: `scripts/admin-responsive-pass.mjs`.)

These browser passes drive the **production build** in headless Chromium:

```bash
npm run preview                     # in one terminal — serves dist/ on :4173
node scripts/map-drawers-pass.mjs   # in another — clip/drag/flick, attribution, zoom
node scripts/map-motion-pass.mjs    # zone load-in/fill ramp, pulse, pins, location, glide, orbs
node scripts/live-data-map-pass.mjs # fonts, live region, popup, report → approve E2E
```

Tiles and webfonts are allowed to fail (offline sandboxes): every assertion targets the app's own UI. Where a sandbox has no browser at all, the DOM/behaviour half of all six items runs in CI via `src/pages/mapPass.test.tsx`.

Additional one-off verification scripts (side-drawer layout, header fade timing, coastal polygon accuracy, hero full-bleed) live in `scripts/` alongside their write-ups in `docs/` — check there before re-deriving something that has already been measured.

Two more real-browser passes cover this session's motion work. `scripts/map-motion-pass.mjs` drives `/map` at 320/390/1280 plus a reduced-motion run and asserts the animation itself rather than only its settled state: the zone load-in stagger, the advisory stroke pulse and dash march (and their freeze while the camera moves), selection dimming, the `flyTo` focus flight, the drawer's first-open stagger, the pill indicator slide and the chevron geometry morph, the pin drop + one-shot ring, the location halo's pause/resume, the intro glide firing exactly once per session, and orb placement never landing over the pills — with a rAF trace, so a loop that costs frames fails. `scripts/route-transition-pass.mjs` does the same for the dissolve: exit/enter fade timing read off the live animation, mean luminance across the dark handover, zero frames showing a blank map, and the enter holding at opacity 0 until the lazy chunk lands. The map-motion pass keeps its full check list in the script header and writes shots to `tmp/map-motion-shots/`; the dissolve is written up in `docs/design-references.md` §21, with before/after frames in `docs/route-transition-shots/`.

## 15. Making common changes

| I want to… | Touch this |
| --- | --- |
| **Add or edit a zone** | `src/data/zones.ts` → then `npm run seed -- --force` to push it. In demo mode, clear `localStorage` to re-seed. Verify the new polygon actually touches the coastline (see §10) before shipping. |
| **Re-shape a zone polygon** | Don't hand-edit coordinates — adjust the anchors/width in `scripts/generate-zones.ts`, re-fetch the coast if needed (see §10), then run `npx tsx scripts/generate-zones.ts` to rewrite `src/data/zones.ts` + `src/data/coastline.ts`. `name` values are asserted verbatim by `src/App.test.tsx`, so change them there too; `description` is free text. Run `npm test` afterwards — `zones.test.ts` asserts the 20 m landward-edge tolerance, self-intersection freedom and non-overlap. |
| **Replace the polygons with real boundaries** | Same file. `polygon` accepts `[lat, lng]` pairs; the mapper also tolerates `{latitude, longitude}` GeoPoints entered in the console. |
| **Change a status colour** | `src/lib/status.ts` (`hex` is what Leaflet draws) **and** the `@theme` block in `src/index.css` — they are duplicated on purpose and must be kept in sync. |
| **Change the advisory wording** | `guidance` in `src/lib/status.ts`; the long explainer is in `src/pages/MapPage.tsx`. |
| **Change report validation limits** | `MIN/MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH` in `src/store.ts`; the 2000-character cap is mirrored in `firestore.rules`. |
| **Change the photo size limit** | `MAX_PHOTO_BYTES` in `src/lib/image.ts`; mirror the limit in the Cloudinary unsigned upload preset. |
| **Tighten security** | Update `firestore.rules` and the Cloudinary unsigned preset restrictions. Replacing the passcode means adding Firebase Auth and gating `Admin.tsx` on it. |
| **Add a new admin action** | Add the action to `src/store.ts` (all datastore calls live there) and call it from `src/pages/Admin.tsx`. |
| **Adjust a drawer's snap feel** | `src/motion/sidePanelAnchors.ts` (projection time, flick velocity, spring constants) — pure and unit-tested, change here before touching `ZoneDrawer.tsx` / `AdvisoryDrawer.tsx`. |
| **Adjust map zone/camera animation timing** | `src/motion/mapMotion.ts` (stagger, flight duration, focus padding), then `src/styles/map-motion.css`. |
| **Adjust the route transition feel** | `src/motion/RouteTransition.tsx` (variants, durations) — re-run `scripts/route-transition-pass.mjs` after any change. |

---

## 16. Recent UI work

Four motion passes — presentation only, no data, network or geometry changes (the full check list for the first three lives in the header of `scripts/map-motion-pass.mjs`, or in the linked write-up):

- **Zone & camera** — polygons fade in on a 70 ms stagger, advisory zones pulse their stroke and march their dash (frozen while the camera moves), a selection dims the other zones, and focusing a zone glides the camera with drawer-aware padding. `scripts/map-motion-pass.mjs`, Phase 1.
- **Drawer, pill & chevron** — the drawer's first open staggers, the status pill's indicator slides, and the chevron folds through a `d` morph rather than spinning. `scripts/map-motion-pass.mjs`, Phase 2.
- **Pins, location, glide & orbs** — report pins drop onto their zone's centroid with one expanding ring, the location dot's halo pauses with the camera, the wide-to-bay intro glide runs once per session, and the ambient orbs never sit over the pills. `scripts/map-motion-pass.mjs`, Phase 3; shots in `tmp/map-motion-shots/`.
- **Route dissolve** — `/` <-> `/map` fades out then rises in, gated on the lazy chunk so the enter never fades in a spinner; `/admin` stays instant. `docs/design-references.md` §21; frames in `docs/route-transition-shots/`.

## 18. Running costs

Everything this app depends on has a meaningful free tier. A small-city deployment — a few hundred unique visitors a month, a handful of reports a week — costs nothing.

---

### Firebase (Firestore)

The free **Spark plan** covers:

| Quota | Free allowance | Typical use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reads | 50,000 / day | Each page load reads 7 zone docs + live report counts. ~6,000 reads per day = ~850 active users. |
| Writes | 20,000 / day | One write per report submission + one per admin action (approve/reject). |
| Deletes | 20,000 / day | Not used — reports and zones are never deleted, only updated. |
| Storage | 1 GB | Zone docs + reports are tiny text. Storage is effectively free until thousands of reports accumulate. |
| Network egress | 10 GB / month | Firestore payloads are small JSON — well within free tier for a community-scale deployment. |

If traffic meaningfully exceeds the Spark limits, **Blaze (pay-as-you-go)** pricing is:
- Reads: \$0.06 per 100,000
- Writes: \$0.18 per 100,000
- Storage: \$0.108 per GB / month

At realistic community scale (5,000 visits/month, 50 reports/month), Blaze cost would be under **\$1/month**.

---

### Cloudinary (photo uploads)

The free tier gives **25 credits/month** (1 credit ≈ 1 image transformation or ~10 MB of storage/bandwidth).

| Action | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| Upload a report photo | ~1 credit per upload |
| Storage | 25 credits covers ~10 GB |
| Bandwidth | Included in the credit pool |

At 50 photo reports/month, this uses 50 credits — exceeding the free tier. Paid plans start at **\$89/month** (200 credits), which is overkill for this use case. The practical option at scale: resize photos client-side before upload (see §13, item 6 — already flagged as a pre-production task), which keeps file sizes under 500 KB and makes the free tier go much further.

If photo uploads are removed entirely (reports text-only), Cloudinary cost is \$0.

---

### OpenStreetMap tiles

Free, no API key, no account. OSM's tile servers are a public service — heavy production traffic should use a tile CDN instead (Stadia Maps, Maptiler, or self-hosted). For a community-scale deployment the default OSM tiles are fine; for a city-wide rollout, budget **\$0–\$25/month** for a tile CDN depending on map usage.

---

### Vercel (hosting)

The **Hobby plan** (free) covers:
- 100 GB bandwidth / month
- Unlimited deploys
- Automatic HTTPS + CDN

This app's production build is ~1.5 MB gzip total. 100 GB bandwidth = ~65,000 full-page loads on the free tier before any cost. For a community advisory tool, the free tier is sufficient indefinitely.

---

### Summary

| Service | Free tier covers | Paid if exceeded |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Firebase Firestore | ~850 daily active users | ~\$0.06–\$0.18 per 100k ops |
| Cloudinary | ~25 photo uploads/month | \$89/month (200 credits) |
| OpenStreetMap tiles | Community scale | \$0–\$25/month (CDN) |
| Vercel hosting | ~65,000 page loads/month | \$20/month (Pro) |

**Realistic total for a Puerto Princesa community deployment: \$0/month.** The only scenario that exceeds free tiers is a viral moment driving thousands of simultaneous users — at which point the app has already done its job.
