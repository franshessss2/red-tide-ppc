/**
 * Dark-ground presentation for the semantic statuses in `src/lib/status.ts`.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * `src/lib/status.ts` is the single source of truth for status → *meaning*
 * (label, Filipino label, public guidance). It also carries light-theme colours
 * (`bg-green-50 text-green-800`), which no longer work on a #080808 ground —
 * a green-50 pill on near-black is a bright blob that destroys the hierarchy.
 *
 * Rather than edit the build agent's semantic module, the design layer derives
 * its own colours from it. Labels and guidance are still read from
 * `ZONE_STATUS_META`, so there is exactly one place to change wording, and one
 * place to change how status *looks*. If the two ever need to converge, fold
 * these tokens back into `status.ts`.
 *
 * ⚠️ As of the design pass, `StatusMeta.badgeClass` and `StatusMeta.softClass`
 * in `src/lib/status.ts` have NO consumers — every component now reads from
 * this file instead. They were left in place rather than deleted because that
 * module is owned by the build agent. They are dead, and they are light-theme:
 * reusing `softClass` would put a `bg-green-50` pill on a #080808 ground. Safe
 * to delete whenever `status.ts` is next touched.
 *
 * COLOUR IS NEVER THE ONLY SIGNAL
 * -------------------------------
 * Fixed badge symbols and text remain visible without motion. On the map,
 * review uses a dashed border and unavailable status uses a dotted border.
 * A received warning stays red even when its date or connection is unknown.

/**
 * How a zone is painted on the Leaflet map.
 *
 * Kept here, next to the theme, so the polygon colour and the badge colour can
 * never drift apart — Leaflet needs raw numbers and hex, React needs classes,
 * and these are the only two places either appears.
 *
 * THE THREE FILL LEVELS ARE A SEQUENCE, NOT THREE STATES
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * `fill` → `fillHover` → `fillSelected` is deliberately a ramp. A tap on a
 * polygon fires `mouseover` before `click` (browsers synthesise hover for touch
 * taps too), so the polygon is already lifting towards `fillHover` in the frames
 * before the popup opens. Leaflet writes these as SVG presentation attributes;
 * `.zone-path` in index.css puts a transition on the element, so the change is
 * interpolated by the compositor rather than cut in. The result is that the
 * popup arrives *onto a lit polygon* instead of appearing next to a static one.
 *
 * Its limitation is honest and worth stating: the popup itself is opened by
 * Leaflet's own click binding, so this ramps *into* the popup rather than
 * gating it. Delaying the open would mean un-binding the popup and reopening it
 * by hand, which risks the zone-click → popup → report-form flow for a
 * sub-200ms effect. Not worth it.
 *
 * `fillOpacity` at rest (0.34–0.42) is high enough that a zone reads as a
 * filled water area, not a traced outline. The zones are ~350–400 m coastal
 * strips; at the default fit zoom (~z10–11) a strip is only ~5–10 px wide, and
 * measured against the dark basemap the old levels (0.16–0.30) produced a fill
 * signal of ~7–18 RGB units for `safe` — weaker than the basemap's own labels
 * and land tint (~45–60), so the strips read as thin outlined lines. The
 * raised levels keep the underlying map legible (place names stay readable
 * through every status) while making the fill the dominant read — see
 * `docs/zone-fill-shots/` for the before/after evidence.
 *
 * The at-rest levels remain a prominence ladder, not three equal voices:
 * `safe` sits furthest back (0.34), `unconfirmed` in the middle (0.38),
 * `advisory` furthest forward (0.42). The steps are smaller than they used to
 * be because the ladder is carried perceptually: `safe`'s sage-teal sits only
 * ~112 RGB units from the dark water, while amber and red sit ~245 away, so
 * equal steps of opacity would leave `safe` invisible next to its neighbours.
 * `safe` quiet, `unconfirmed`/`advisory` loud is the hierarchy; hue does most
 * of that work, opacity keeps it honest. The same ladder runs through
 * `strokeOpacity` — see below.
 *
 * STROKE OPACITY IS PART OF THE LADDER
 * ------------------------------------
 * There is no glow filter on the polygons; what read as a halo around `safe`
 * outlines was the neon #3ddc84 stroke at 0.95 on a near-black ground — bright
 * saturated green simply looks like it emits light there. `safe` now paints
 * its outline at 0.7 so its border reads as a quiet boundary, while
 * `advisory`/`unconfirmed` keep 0.95 and stay the loudest lines on the map.
 * Every outline also sits on a dark casing (`ZONE_CASING`, below) so touching
 * zones keep a visible seam even when they share a status.
 * `weight` is left identical across statuses on purpose: the selected-zone
 * emphasis and the dash for `unconfirmed` are the shape signals, and the press
 * ramp in index.css assumes every status shares the same lift.

/**
 * Dark casing drawn under every zone outline.
 *
 * WHY
 * ---
 * Adjacent zones can share a boundary — `pp-bay` and `irawan` meet along a
 * ~300m seam at the bay mouth, and the Honda Bay strips touch too. When both
 * are the same status the seam is a single stroke of the *same hex as both
 * fills*, and at `safe`'s low stroke opacity it all but vanishes: the two
 * zones read as one blob of water. Status colour is not the answer (both are,
 * correctly, safe), and nudging fill opacity per zone would break the meaning
 * of the prominence ladder above.
 *
 * Instead each ring is drawn twice: once here, in the ground colour, slightly
 * wider than the status stroke and in a pane *below* every zone; then the
 * status stroke on top. The result is the standard cartographic "casing": a
 * thin dark edge either side of every outline, so where two outlines meet
 * there are two dark edges with the status line between them and the boundary
 * survives regardless of what colours sit on either side. It also gives every
 * outline a little more separation from the inverted basemap, which is a
 * mild improvement everywhere, not just at seams.
 *
 * `extraWeight` is total (split half to each side), so at rest a 2px status
 * stroke gets ~1.25px of dark edge each side. Kept small: this is an edge,
 * not a border.
