/**
 * The landing hero's backdrop, and the single place that decides whether any
 * WebGL is allowed to exist on this page.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS WebGL HERE AT ALL
 * ------------------------------
 * This project's standing constraint is "no WebGL / canvas-heavy effects" —
 * the audience is coastal Puerto Princesa on rural connectivity and low-end
 * Android. The Ferrofluid hero is an explicitly signed-off exception, scoped
 * to the hero panel only, and it is paid for with every mitigation below.
 * See `docs/design-references.md` §15.
 *
 * THE MITIGATIONS, ALL OF THEM
 * ----------------------------
 *  1. **Reduced motion mounts no canvas.** If `prefers-reduced-motion` is set
 *     the lazy chunk is never imported and no GL context is ever created —
 *     the static gradient below is the whole backdrop. This is a hard skip,
 *     not a paused canvas.
 *  2. **Lazy-loaded.** `ogl` sits in its own chunk behind `React.lazy`, so the
 *     landing page's HTML, CSS and app JS parse and paint without it. On a 3G
 *     connection the page is readable before the shader arrives.
 *  3. **`dpr={1}`.** Not `devicePixelRatio`. On a DPR-3 phone this is a 9×
 *     reduction in fragments shaded per frame, and the effect is a soft
 *     out-of-focus glow that nobody can tell apart at 1×.
 *  4. **Paused off-screen.** An `IntersectionObserver` on the hero stops the
 *     rAF loop the moment it scrolls away — the rest of the landing page
 *     scrolls with no GL work at all.
 *  5. **Paused on `document.hidden`.** A backgrounded tab renders nothing.
 *  6. **No pointer interaction.** `mouseInteraction={false}`: this is a
 *     glance, not a toy, and it also means no `pointermove` handler on the
 *     main thread during scroll.
 *  7. **Deferred first mount.** The canvas is only imported once the browser
 *     is idle, so it never competes with first paint or with the live
 *     Firestore subscription the figures depend on.
 *
 * The gradient underneath is always painted, WebGL or not — so the hero never
 * flashes as a black hole, and a failed chunk load is invisible.

 *     any given instant its glow can be elsewhere, and without a permanent
 *     base the outer slivers of a wide viewport read as flat black: exactly

 *     the margins are never empty, for reduced-motion users and WebGL-less
 *     devices just as much as for everyone else.

 * invisible, because nothing exists beyond it. (A horizontal feather pass
 * used to live here, but only to disguise the content-column clip the
 * backdrop was mounted in; full-bleed made it redundant, and keeping it would
 * have left the outer margins of the band texture-less — the very bug the
 * band wrapper exists to fix. See docs/design-references.md §20.)
 *
 * What remains is the vertical pass: the band dissolves into the page ground
 * at its top (it starts directly under the header — without the fade that
 * edge measured a 15–28/255 luminance step) and at its bottom, where the
 * `Waves` canvas takes over, so the texture never ends on a visible line.
