/**
 * The advisory-signal gauge card as a collapsible side drawer.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS
 * ----------
 * The "Advisory signal" card (the 0% gauge + 0/7 ADV · 0 PEND readout) sits
 * in the top-right control column, between the zoom buttons and the zone
 * drawer's tab. On a phone it permanently covers that corner of the map, so
 * it tucks away into the RIGHT edge, leaving only a grab tab.
 *
 * The drawer moved from the left edge to the right edge in the pass that
 * replaced the bottom sheet with the zone drawer: the screenshot markup
 * pulled the collapsed grab tab to the top-right, and both drawer tabs now
 * live in one column — mirrored, the tab hugs the window's INNER (left) edge
 * and the card slides in and out of the right screen edge. What did NOT move
 * is the clip architecture below, which is the part that was verified and
 * must not regress. Its orientation is an input, not a rewrite: the same
 * hook, the same one-motion-value-drives-track-and-window invariant, the
 * same tap-after-drag guard.
 *
 * This is the drawer half of the split from the old merged `StatusPanel`,
 * which incorrectly swept the pills row into the swipeable panel and shipped
 * a rendering bug: content visibly bleeding outside the panel bounds during
 * partial-open states. The pills row now lives in `StatusKey.tsx` — fixed,
 * never in this subtree — and this drawer is built so that bug class cannot
 * recur:
 *
 * CLIP ARCHITECTURE (why content can never bleed)
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * The old panel translated the whole `[card + tab]` row rigidly and relied
 * on the *viewport edge* to clip it mid-drag, with translucent blurred cards
 * inside the translated subtree. `backdrop-filter` inside a transformed
 * ancestor is a known-bad combination on mobile GPUs: the blurred backdrop
 * layer can detach from its element mid-gesture while the text keeps
 * painting — floating disconnected text outside the visible card.
 *
 * This drawer clips structurally instead:
 *
 *   1. The card track slides inside a dedicated clip window
 *      (`overflow-hidden`) whose width is derived from the SAME motion value
 *      as the track's position. At `open` the window fits the whole card, at
 *      `collapsed` it is 0, and mid-drag it is exactly the visible
 *      remainder — the card is continuously clipped by the window at every
 *      drag position, and the viewport edge is never load-bearing.
 *   2. Nothing inside the translated track uses `backdrop-blur`. The gauge
 *      card is a solid `bg-ink-2`, so there is no backdrop layer to detach.
 *      (The grab tab keeps its blur: it is a static sibling, never inside a
 *      transformed ancestor.)
 *   3. The window width is clamped at both ends (`drawerWindowWidth`), so
 *      elastic overshoot past either anchor still clips cleanly.
 *
 * RIGHT-EDGE GEOMETRY — the mirror of the original left drawer
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * The row is [tab][window], right-aligned inside the control column, so the
 * window's right edge is pinned and its LEFT edge is the moving cut. The
 * track is `justify-end`-aligned inside the window (hugging the pinned
 * edge), and `offsets.collapsed` is `+cardWidth`: the track slides right,
 * into the edge, to tuck away. `drawerWindowWidth` mirrors to `width - x`,
 * the elastic ends swap, the chevron points the way the panel will move, and
 * ArrowRight collapses / ArrowLeft expands — every direction a user can
 * perceive flips, none of the maths does (see `sidePanelAnchors.ts`, where
 * the flick map is derived from the offsets themselves).
 *
 * States:
 *   open:      card fully visible (the resting position).
 *   collapsed: window at width 0; only the 44px grab tab shows. The collapsed
 *     drawer captures no pointer events, so pan/zoom/tap-zones work where the
 *     card used to sit.
 *
 * Animation:
 *   The same spring everywhere (stiffness 420, damping 34, mass 0.85), so
 *   this drawer and the zone drawer feel like one physics system. The card
 *   follows the finger 1:1 mid-drag; on release, velocity is projected
 *   forward (0.2s) and a flick always lands in the direction it was thrown.
 *   For reduced-motion the track jumps instantly (`offsetX.jump`), and the
 *   window follows through the same motion-value subscription.
 *
 * Drag surface (deliberately ONLY the tab):
 *   The gauge card stays `pointer-events-none` — it is a read-only instrument
 *   and map gestures pass through it. Giving it a drag surface would newly
 *   swallow map pans starting on that 172px card, which would be a regression
 *   for map interaction, not a feature.
 *
 * Non-drag path (accessibility is load-bearing, not optional):
 *   - the grab tab is a real `<button>`: tap / Enter / Space toggles;
 *   - ArrowRight collapses and ArrowLeft expands when the tab is focused —
 *     the directional pair for a RIGHT-edge drawer, so keyboard users get
 *     the same directional control as swipe users;
 *   - `aria-expanded` + `aria-controls` expose the state to assistive tech.
 *   - on desktop/non-touch there is no separate path to learn: the same tab
 *     is a click toggle and a mouse-drag handle. No swipe simulation.

 * merged panel shipped. See the module doc above.
