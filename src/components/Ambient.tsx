/**
 * Ambient instruments for the map surface.
 *
 * WHY THESE EXIST
 * ---------------
 * The category default for a civic map is a pastel card grid with a friendly
 * illustration. The subject here is a tide that poisons shellfish — it deserves
 * the instrument register: a schematic trace, a scan, monospaced readouts.
 * `Scanline` is the ambient half of the motif — a slow sonar sweep across the
 * map. One compositor-only `translateY` loop, no JS, and it stops entirely
 * under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
 *
 * (The advisory-signal gauge used to live here as `TideGauge`; it now lives
 * in the collapsible `AdvisoryDrawer`, under the fixed `StatusKey` pills row.
 * No restore needed — the split reuses the same gauge markup and chip markup
 * in their new homes, and nothing else was deleted with them.)
 *
 * Both are pointer-events-none and sit under the sheet, so neither can intercept
 * a map gesture or outlive its usefulness at the full anchor.
