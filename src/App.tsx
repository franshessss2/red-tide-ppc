 * round trip fetching the incoming chunk while the incoming frame sits at
 * opacity 0 — which reads as a dead beat in the middle of the animation. The
 * landing page calls this on pointer-enter/focus of either map CTA, so the
 * chunk is normally already in cache by the time the click lands and the
 * transition runs start to finish.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* called on load: the whole point of the lazy boundary is
 * that the landing page and /admin never download the map (see
 * vite.config.ts `manualChunks` and docs/design-references.md §14.3), and an
 * idle prefetch would spend that budget on people who never open the map.

    held at opacity 0 (see `RouteTransition`), so this window is *dark* — and dark
    is the right answer. A brand mark or a spinner appearing out of a dissolve
    and then handing over to the map is the one thing that makes a route
    transition look like a prototype, so there is nothing here to see.

    It keeps its box (`min-h-dvh`, on the ink ground) so the document does not
    collapse while the chunk loads, and keeps its `role`/label so assistive tech
    still hears that the map is loading.
