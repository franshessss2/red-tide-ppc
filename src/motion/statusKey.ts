 * zone is in — the pill row doubles as "where is my selection on this scale".
 * Otherwise the worst status that actually exists on the map owns the
 * highlight (one advisory anywhere is the thing worth pointing at); and no records means `unknown`.
 *
 * Pure function, unit-tested — same policy as `mapMotion.ts`.
